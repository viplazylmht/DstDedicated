# Dont Starve Together Dedicated Server Auto Setup

Author: [viplazylmht](https://github.com/viplazylmht/)

## What is this?

This is a hand-on tutorial that allow you to create and maintain a _dedicated server_ of Don't Starve Together.

## Why is this?

So, by follow to this tutorial, you can run a dedicated server in a **cloud** instead of your local machine. Yah it called remote cluster.

Recall that the `cloud` I use is Google Cloud, and this has serveral of benefits, I will told you now:  

### **Advantages**

 - Fast.
 - Lots of memory.
 - Powerful. Yah this is the main purpose when I choose this one.
 - Free, but you can deal a `pro version` if needed.

### **Disadvantages**

 - Command line only
 - Manual save cluster server files is required when you leave the runtime.
 - The runtime will be forced leave after a period of time. This usually 12 hours, but may be less. You can bypass this limitaton by using `pro version` xD.  
 - Need to open a browser tab just to maintain the runtime. But pro version may help this one.

## How to do that?

Yh, you interested xD. So just open [this link](https://colab.research.google.com/github/viplazylmht/DstDedicated/blob/main/Setup_DST_Dedicated.ipynb) and follow my lead from here.
